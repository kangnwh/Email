#### Install MySql 5.7

##### The whole installation steps can refer to [url](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/linux-installation-yum-repo.html)
```shell
Login as root
wget http://repo.mysql.com//mysql57-community-release-el6-9.noarch.rpm
rpm -ivh http://repo.mysql.com//mysql57-community-release-el6-9.noarch.rpm
yum install mysql-community-server -y > mysql_install.log
yum install -y MySQL-python.x86_64
yum install mysql-devel.x86_64 -y
service mysqld start
#get the temp password for root
grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log

#add below line into /etc/my.cnf and restart mysqld service using root
character_set_server=utf8

service mysqld stop
service mysqld start


#change password for root
mysql -uroot
#Input the temp password here
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pw4Mysql!';
```
> Note MySQL's validate_password plugin is installed by default. This will require that passwords contain at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one digit, and one special character, and that the total password length is at least 8 characters.


##### Create database and user id
```sql
create database emall character set utf8;
grant ALL PRIVILEGES ON emall.* to 'emall'@'%' identified by 'dbpw4LS!' with grant option;
grant ALL PRIVILEGES ON emall.* to 'emall'@'localhost' identified by 'dbpw4LS!' with grant option;
```
